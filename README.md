#Aphorisms
##A simple program that prints thought-provoking messages of wisdom every time the program is run. 

The aphroisms come from a book called "Jing-Si Aphroisms", a collection of simple pieces of wisdom from Dharma Master Cheng Yen. With a list of almost 40 aphorisms, there is surely something here for everyone from all walks of life. 

Simply run it and recieve something new to consider.
